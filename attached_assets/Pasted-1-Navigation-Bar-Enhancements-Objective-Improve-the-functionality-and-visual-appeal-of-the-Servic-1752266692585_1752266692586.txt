1. Navigation Bar Enhancements
Objective: Improve the functionality and visual appeal of the "Services" section in the navigation bar.

Implement a hover-triggered dropdown menu for the "Services" item in the navbar.

When a user hovers over the "Services" link, the dropdown should automatically appear without requiring a click.

For each item within the dropdown menu, include a contextually relevant icon that visually represents the type of service offered.

Example: A gear icon for "API Integration," a chat bubble for "Support Services," etc.

Ensure the dropdown design aligns with the current UI theme and is fully responsive across all device types.

2. Floating Announcement Bar Above Navbar
Objective: Introduce a persistent top-level bar for showcasing important announcements and contact details.

Add a floating strip positioned above the main navigation bar.

This strip should include:

Contact information (e.g., a phone number and email address)

Working hours

Latest offers or promotions

Ensure the text is horizontally scrollable on mobile devices and clearly visible across all screen sizes.

Apply subtle animation or transition (like sliding or fading) to draw attention to ongoing updates.

3. New Category in Navbar: Fintech Services
Objective: Add a new navigation item dedicated to Fintech software and APIs.

Insert a new menu item titled "Fintech Solutions" in the navbar.

On hover or click, show a dropdown or sub-section that outlines the range of services, which include:

Software and API development for business operations

Domestic Money Transfer (DMT) integration

Utility Payment Collection (e.g., electricity, water, gas)

Pay-in and Pay-out gateway integration

Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) API

Mobile Recharge and DTH Recharge APIs

AEPS (Aadhaar Enabled Payment System) API integration

White-label B2B software offerings

Use a structured layout and possibly group the services under subheadings if the list is long.

Consider using service icons or badges to visually distinguish each offering.

4. Chatbot Interface Integration
Objective: Provide basic user engagement via a chatbot, with a placeholder response.

Add a chatbot widget fixed at the bottom-right corner of the application.

When clicked, the chatbot should open a chat window.

For now, configure the chatbot to respond to all user inputs with the following standard message:

"Thank you for reaching out! For detailed assistance, please contact us at [email@example.com] or call us at [your-phone-number]."

Ensure the chatbot interface is minimalistic, mobile-responsive, and does not interfere with the main content.

5. Pricing Section in Navbar
Objective: Provide users easy access to detailed pricing information for various services.

Add a "Pricing" link in the navigation bar.

Clicking on this should lead to (or scroll to) a new Pricing page or section.

The pricing section should clearly differentiate between the various services and their respective fee structures.

Example: API Setup Fees, Monthly Subscription Costs, Transaction Charges, Support Fees, etc.

Consider using a pricing table or comparison chart format for better clarity.

Allow for easy updates so the pricing can be changed dynamically later if needed.
